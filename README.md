# Convolutional Neural Networks for the identification of signatures of natural selection and functional mutations in the human genome

## realdata_FASTA.py

###### Script to convert real genetic allignment data into images; it produces three multi-population images and three single-population images for each population contained in the file .FASTA. 

REQUIREMENTS: Python 3.6

INPUT: Two FASTA files that contain allignment genetic sequences; a reference genome (gene\_anc.fasta) and several genomes of the populations (gene\_gene.fasta). 

## MSMS_images.py

###### Script to convert simulated genetic allignment data into images; it produces a black and white image (derived/ancestral allele) for each simulation replicate.

REQUIREMENTS: Python 3.6

INPUT: Genetic simulations from MSMS software (http://www.mabs.at/ewing/msms/index.shtml)
